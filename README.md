## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I had abetter idea of how to work with CSS Flexbox which I used to create the two-column layout.

I learnt about css media query which i used to create the mobile responsive design.

I learnt how to center a button by putting the button in a div and giving the div a property of (text-align:center).

```html
 <div class="reg-btn"><button>Register</button></div>
 ```
```css
 .reg-btn {
    margin-top: 10px;
    text-align: center;
  }
```
I learnt how to use the pseudo before and after element to give a border to the icons. I also learnt how to embed icons in your project by downloading the font-pack and linking it to the head tag of the html element.

### Continued development

in future projects i'd love to implement more media queries and also learn mobile first responsive design.I'd also learn to use flexbox more to create a more responsive design.
